Top:
- Backup tables schema (Trainer & Dictionary)
- Store history of the recordings. Save best recordings with the date so that I was able to compare them over time to check my progress
- Allow separate recording of words if dictionary entry has several meanings (I, II)
- Add a button to remember/highlight a record in the Recorder
- Allow comparison of my own pronunciations at the wave forms dialog
- Compare different reference pronunciation or different recorded ones
- Add a shortcut for playing ref and rec sounds simultaneosuly

Waveforms:
- Implement logic of silence finder and automatically stop recording if there's a long pause
- Clip pauses at the end and at the beginning in the Waveform
- Add ability to move and stretch waveforms with a slider
- Separate waveform on segments and allow to play a certain segment
- Add word name to the last played audio
- Play sound along with moving a slider on waveform

Migration to DB:
- Try loading .html page from a database. Test performance. 
- Results:
	DB size: 2GB vs. 1GB in file system. To reduce size:
		- zip content to make (2x smaller) 
		- store binary data (image) instead of ntext to use UTF8
		- store mp3 separately to avoid Base64 conversion (1/4 smaller)
		- use Int32 keys instead of Guids (a few Mbs smaller)
	Need to change all hyperlinks on a page to call jscript function which calls external function
	What about images? Should we also embed them?
	Can we specify base folder for the browser control and put all other stuff (css, js, images) there?
	Reponse time is very fast.
- Generation:
	Migrate my recordings to be linked by sound key
	Test word lists
- Code:
	implement back/forward
	Ensure that my recordings aren't lost because the keys (and subfolders) will be different in DB provider
	We don't need to get firstUK/Us audio from jScript anymore (we have a relation in the database). 
	But don't forget that the last played audio should always be used
	Specify max DB size in the connection string - calculate it based on file size (max is 4000 Mb)
	Cache last N files and played audio (preload only one audio? based on the playback settings)

Other:
- When I change language and click "Play" it still plays the old audio
- Add a handler for the double-click on the audio list item
- Add a switch to hide/display exercise desription
- Add recording duration to the recordings list
- Add column "CD+Track" instead of page and sort by it
- Add special signs explanation (LPD or Amazon)
- generate html for pronunciation notes (from dictionary CD)
- Create base MessageBox with predefined captions
- Allow recording when the application is not active

Generation of the pages:
- check errors in "don't" - AmE is not separated 
- 'pause' transcript is incorrect in Lingvo
