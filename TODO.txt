Top:
- Test playing very big file (memory usage and correct completion)
- Show audio length even without palying the audio.
- Specify recording duration somewhere (both reference and recorded). Add recording duration to the recordings list
- Add recording length column to Training (probably, get from the latest audio)
- Display the current target key in History dialog?
- Create base MessageBox with predefined captions
- Bugs
	- BUG: cannot save big reference audio into database
	- Add handling for "EntityValidationErrors" (too long text etc)
	- Bug: sometimes it's possible to start two players (rec and ref) simultineously
	- Bug when sequence is scheduled and I start another action
	- Bug: When I change language and click "Play" it still plays the old audio
	- There are no tags in my exported mp3 files
- Performance:
	- Profile memory: when Exercise tab is first loaded etc.
	- Why it eats so much memory? Elaborate (try working without DB)
	- Test InMemory recorder - how much memory does it eats for long recordings? Should we flush to disk?
	- Reduce startup time
	- Optimize IsAudioExists calls (AudioPanel currently makes it twice)
	- Cache latest audio files in providers (especially, LPD)
	- Specify max DB size in the connection string - calculate it based on file size (max is 4000 Mb)
- New functionality:
	- Add a setting "Decrease recorded audio volume"
	- Add ability to mark certain words as problematic and practice them later
	- Compare different reference pronunciation or different recorded ones
	- Add special signs explanation (LPD or Amazon)
	- Generate html for pronunciation notes (from dictionary CD)
	- Add a "Sound search" functionality
	- Create a text version of each sentence/phrase to be able to perform full text search
	- Play any word in the dictionary when I double click on it
- Usability improvements
	- Add a possibility to start background action passing arguments explicitly. Simplify delegates signatures (some don't need ActionContext etc.)
	- Topics sorting in Exercise list is done by ID, not by text
	- Add parent topic to the topics list (align  right)
	- Add a switch to hide/display exercise description

Waveforms:
- Show waveforms even without palying the audio. Select several recordings and display waveforms for all of them
- Implement logic of silence finder and automatically stop recording if there's a long pause
- Clip pauses at the end and at the beginning in the Waveform
- Add ability to move and stretch waveforms with a slider
- Separate waveform on segments and allow to play a certain segment
- Add word name to the last played audio
- Play sound along with moving a slider on waveform

Audio migration to DB:
- Attach reference audios to Trainings. Clean garbadge
- Shrink database after migration (both LPD and Trainer) and upload them
- Backup all exercises (png+mp3) and upload them
- Check exercises that have no recordings (see log). Upload 20, 21, 23 manually

Possible problems:
- Deleting many exercises may cause an exception because IN statement would be too long (when deleting recorded audios)

Generation of the pages:
- check errors in "don't" - AmE is not separated 
- 'pause' transcript is incorrect in Lingvo
