Top:
- Try installing video card, then try giving more memory to video adapter
--
- Fix errors in Macmillan top words ("le", "lo" etc.)
- Find words that are in the Rank but not matched -> maybe they will be match with MW word forms
- Add auto list: word with several recordings. Mark such words in the list somehow
- Add word forms from MW
-
- Search: we must also match items with accented characters (e.g. à la carte, Ælfric)
- Delete a word from category with DEL (not Backspace, remove Backspace also from Recordings list) 
- Add records count to the suggestions list
- Add total statistics (recorded N words over Y days). Move statistics from status bar to a dedicated tab.
- Change index logic: use only "text + rank + wordId" and load other info (isFavorite, htmlIndex, sounds, wordnote) from DB. Measure speed drop. Measure the reduce of memory usage (by 12MB?)
- Add ability to add notes for a word
- Add ability to rewind player by 1/3 seconds (should be configurable)
- BUG: load application, quickly type , hit Enter - nothing happens
- Lazy load categories (only if tab is visible)
- Remove some logging
- Somehow mark the entries from LDOCE/MW in UI
- Find the best audio for "American Accent Training" paragraph (ex. 3-39 - read fast)
LDOCE import:
	- Improvements:
		- MW: scrub ", the"
		- MW: some entries may not have main sound but there's a sound later in [m1]• (see New York -> New Yorker)
		- MW: analyze and group words if they have the same sounds but differ only by pronunciation (Washington, Castro). Take the longer transcription?
		- MW: put word forms both into main article and as a dedicated word
		- import variants [i]also[/i], [i]or[/i]. Think how to match with LPD.
		- import derived forms [m1]• (abandon -> abandonment). Probably, to different entry as LPD does.
		- import [com]([b]  (inflected form: able-abler-ablest) and [com]([i]plural[/i]  (plurals). May even without audio? Import into entry.
		- Ensure that new entries don't match the default MW entries
		- Resolve references in LPD ("am" -> see "I'm", except ... -> ... (ref) ) and MW
		- Add more information to LDOCE and MW articles (e.g. "movie")
	- Word forms are lost:
		- plurals
		- be -> was " [com]" (be000002.wav)
		- twenty -> [m1]• [b]twen·ti·eth[/b] [s]twenty03.wav[/s] (in LPD "ninetieth" is a separate entry)
	- Change color of dictionary name
	- Sound button is lower then collocation/MW entry
	- Generate hyperlink for MW [ref] (both in file system and database)
	- Add table Dictionaries. Register sound key prefix there (then change logic of current audio text in DictionaryContextt)
	- Find words that present only in MW (with several audios)
	- Clean DIC folder and generate file system entries. Test MW entries: UI and sounds
	- Generate iPhone entries and upload them to iPhone (don't forget to change mobile .css)
	- If possible - find other pronunciations inside LDOCE articles (e.g. for word forms - see abduction)
	- Analyze words that present in LPD but miss in LDOCE
	- ? [analyze] DB mode: don't import sounds that have "_lpd_" inside and can be matched to the existing LPD sound. Remap them instead.
	- Backup database and binaries
	- CSS: 
		- ".entry_text strong" migrate to ".entry_name", 
		- LPD misses "part_of_speech" (it's just <em>)
HTML to WPF migration:
	- Find a better way to distinguish buttons with the same audio key than displaying the key in UI
	- Display a note if a button has an assosiated recording (or display a list with all my recordings for this article?)
	- Allow to play the associated recording by clicking on the button (CTRL ?)
	- Change visual looks of buttons 
- Bugs
	- Alt+left/right arrow doesn't work when focus is inside the browser
	- When doubleclick on the item in audio list, refresh context is called two times: selection changed and double click
	- Add handling for "EntityValidationErrors" (too long text etc)
	- Bug: sometimes it's possible to start two players (rec and ref) simultineously
	- Bug when sequence is scheduled and I start another action
	- There are no tags in my exported mp3 files
	- Before removing the FakeEntity (for Exercise and Training) ensure they are not loaded into dbcontext
	- Parts of speech have dedicated tag in LDOCE/MW but in LPD they are just <em> (see "buffet")
- Performance:
	- Get rid of entity framework in lists (Exercises, Trainings, Comboboxes, Categories) - use it only when updating/inserting detailed record
	- If we switch to using int32 instead of string as Words/Collocations reference to Sounds it reduces RAM by 4MB. Problems: can't easily cleanup Sounds table on reimport (foreign key)
	- Before deploying DB it should be warmed-up (load some pages etc)
	- Profile memory: when Exercise tab is first loaded etc.
	- If we assign all index entries for LPD it eats + 6 MB (slowly, in background)
	- Why it eats so much memory? Elaborate (try working without DB)
	- Why it eats so much memory when saving large audio files? (50 mb file and 400mb eats the application)
	- Test InMemory recorder - how much memory does it eats for long recordings? Should we flush to disk?
	- Optimize IsAudioExists calls (AudioPanel currently makes it twice)
	- Cache latest audio files in providers (especially, LPD)
	- Specify max DB size in the connection string - calculate it based on file size (max is 4000 Mb)
	- Think of another DB engine (SQLLite?). Test it with big databases and storing image/binary/ntext data.  
- New functionality:
	- Add ability to pause the recording
	- Find some good dictionary with Russian translations
	- Add at least main russian meaning to the LPD (from popup dictionary?)
	- Import spelling-to-sound from LPD
	- During import add a flag "several pronunciations/meanings". Then use this flag for autolist "several pronunciations"
	- Add ability to search by wildcards (e.g. select a certain problematic syllable - lrt - and practice many words with it)
	- Add ability to expand list when I click on "..." (e.g. I want to through all items)
	- Add bility to exclude "collocations" from search (useful when moving down the list of words)
	- Add a setting "Decrease recorded audio volume"
	- Long records: improve usability (back/forward a few seconds, repeat a region etc.)
	- Compare different reference pronunciation or different recorded ones
	- Add special signs explanation (LPD or Amazon)
	- Add a "Sound search" functionality
	- Create a text version of each sentence/phrase to be able to perform full text search
	- Play any word in the dictionary when I double click on it
	- Add ability to add any word in the exercise to dictionary favorites
	- Add a setting "Active book" to avoid displaying exercises from other books
	- Add auto lists: words with notes, trouble words (many attempts to rccord at a time)
	- Extract transcription for each word and store in the database
	- Add ability to search by phonetic symbols (see LPD implementation).
- Usability improvements
	- Sometimes I want to assign to category a word form (e.g. earlier ->  hard to pronounce). It's not possible currently
	- Too little space for the category name
	- When pointing the cursor to category name should its full name and description
	- Display wveforms even during playback
	- Improve tab headers: add tooltips and icons
	- Add special and phonetic symbols explanations (both for LPD and LDOCE)
	- Improve category dialog: add with hot key, delete with DEL
	- Rename Trainings to Readings or Dialogs
	- Don't play Reference audio automatically after the recording for long audios?
	- Use + and - images instead of "Add"/"Delete" text
	- Make EN/US buttons in LPD html smaller when targeting database (they are rarely clicked)
	- Topics sorting in Exercise list is done by ID, not by text
	- Add parent topic to the topics list (align  right)
	- Add a switch to hide/display exercise description
	- We should be able to see waveforms when an audio is playing (but not when is recording)
	- Review logic for building TOP words - why it's 1200 instead of 1000?
	- Don't show message box if dictionary is missing - show error inside the tab (for those who don't want to use dictionary)
	- History dialog: duration is confusing without a caption
- Code improvements:
	- Ensure all DB indexes, PKs, and relations don't have autogenerated names (because EF uses these names and may fail if we recreate the entity)
	- Add a handling to MessageHelper when message needs to be shown from a background thread
	- Use stack panel in AudioPanel (read first what is better: Grid or stack panel)
	- Use Lazy for Active record in Exercise/Trainig details dialog
	- Add error logging (write all errors to the log). 
	- Improve error handling during databinding: give more informative error messages. Sometimes errors are not thrown (raise error inside EditCategories.ascx -> Categories property)
	- Add a possibility to start background action passing arguments explicitly. Simplify delegates signatures (some don't need ActionContext etc.)
	- Check if page URLs like 'file://127.0.0.1/C$/Folder/.../file.html' will work for non-admins (see method PrepareNavigationUri() in DictionaryContainer)
Waveforms:
	- Add ability to play audio in the dialog
	 -Add ability to play selected part of a waveform
	- Select several recordings and display waveforms for all of them
	- Clip pauses at the end and at the beginning in the Waveform
	- Add ability to move and stretch waveforms with a slider
	- Add word name to the last played audio
	- Play sound along with moving a slider on waveform
	- Add ability to show real amplitude of the sounds (don't stretch them) to compare loudness 
Deployment:
	- Add logic to check if it's an updated version and call some migration logic (MUST be done before deployment!)
	- Think how a new changes to the database will be deployed (consider that all audio/html index will be broken)
	- Deploy also "Index.txt" to speedup first start

Possible problems:
- Deleting many exercises may cause an exception because IN statement would be too long (when deleting recorded audios)

Generation of the pages:
- check errors in "don't" - AmE is not separated 
- 'pause' transcript is incorrect in Lingvo
