Top:
- Add ability to delete audio by "DEL" (at least in Training)
- Optimize IsAudioExists calls (AudioPanel currently makes it twice)
- Test InMemory recorder - how much memory does it eats for long recordings? Should we flush to disk?
- Specify recording duration somewhere (both reference and recorded)
- Bug: sometimes it's possible to start two players (rec and ref) simultineously
- Bug when sequence is scheduled and I start another action
- Add reference audio for Recordings
- Add a possibility to record several audios for a single reference audio in Exercises
- Migrate all existing exercises to use images from DB?

- Don't load all tabs on app start
- Display number of symbols in Training text
- Add recording length column to Training (probably, get from the latest audio)
- Add handling for "EntityValidationErrors" (too long text etc)
- Add ability to mark certain words as problematic and practice them later
- Allow to make several recordings per source and select the best one
- Store history of the recordings. Save best recordings with the date so that I was able to compare them over time to check my progress
- Allow to make several recordings and compare them
- Allow comparison of my own pronunciations at the wave forms dialog (or several recorded ones)
- Compare different reference pronunciation or different recorded ones
- Add parent topic to the topics list(align  right)
- Reduce startup time
- Why it eats so much memory? Elaborate (try working without DB)
- Add a button to remember/highlight a record in the Recorder
- Add a shortcut for playing ref and rec sounds simultaneosuly
- Create a text version of each sentence/phrase to be able to perform full text search
- Play any word in the dictionary when I double click on it.

- Open detailed dialogs as tabs of the Exercise list (as in MVVM article)
- Add special signs explanation (LPD or Amazon)

- Add a "Sound search" functionality

Waveforms:
- Implement logic of silence finder and automatically stop recording if there's a long pause
- Clip pauses at the end and at the beginning in the Waveform
- Add ability to move and stretch waveforms with a slider
- Separate waveform on segments and allow to play a certain segment
- Add word name to the last played audio
- Play sound along with moving a slider on waveform

Migration to DB:
	Move RegisterPage method to LoadCompleted event
	Specify max DB size in the connection string - calculate it based on file size (max is 4000 Mb)
	Cache last N files and played audio (preload only one audio? based on the playback settings)

Audio migration to DB:
- Test:
	- Upload 20, 21, 23 manually
	- Shrink database after migration (both LPD and Trainer)
	- Check exercises that have no recordings (see log)
- Requirements: 
	- Add reference audio to Training
	- Add ability to export reference/recorded audio (for all types of entities)
	- Add a functionality for working with audio history (think through)
	- Add a setting: preserve old audio if it's at least one week old
- Backup all exercises (png+mp3)

Generation of the pages:
- check errors in "don't" - AmE is not separated 
- 'pause' transcript is incorrect in Lingvo
