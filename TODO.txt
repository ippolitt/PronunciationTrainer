Top:
- Try installing video card, then try giving more memory to video adapter
--
- Add a beep at the start of a recording (configurable, default is false)
- Learn "ɪn ˈkriːs ⇨ɪŋ-," transition
- Statistics:
	- Add total statistics (recorded N words over Y days).
	- Add a dedicated bar with overall statistics
	- Remember the last N words I recorded (or viewed?) the dictionary
- Add ability to rewind player by 1 or 3 seconds (should be configurable)
- Assign a shortcut to a category for adding/removing a word
- Somehow mark the entries from LDOCE/MW in UI (when they present as a dedicated entry because MW phonetic symbols differ)
- Rethink how active audio is displayed (once we now highlight the button). Highlight active audio on page load (see "hello").
- Delete recordings for "ldoce_"
- Lazy load categories (only if tab is visible)
- Remove some logging
- Find the best audio for "American Accent Training" paragraph (ex. 3-39 - read fast)
Dictionary:
	- Import
		- iPhone: 
			- Should we allow new words from LDOCE and MW? E.g. word forms?
		- MW:
			- don't merge ", the" in MW
			- why "Mac" is not merged (the same sounds?)
		- LDOCE: 
			Trim ", Mr and , Mrs"?
			- preserve meanings if they differ by pronunciation and group during import, preferring sounds that miss in LPD (see "detail")
			- "second-hand" - how to know which variant to use?
		- LPD: note that multy-entries ("process") are separated in the dictionary. I might also do it for DB mode (ranks? matching with other dictionaries?)
		- Don't delete a word if there's custom information there (custom notes etc.)
		- MW: don't import phrases with foreign pronunciation (à la belle étoile,  à la russe) - see "foreign term" flag
		- LDOCE: Display audio only if it differs from LPD (or do not display at all?). This will also reduce size on iPhone
			- ? Don't import LDOCE sounds if it's a fragment (but some words have better transcription than LPD ("process"))
		- LDOCE: entries like "-meter": maybe show two keywords and allow to see two articles?
		- LPD: 
			Fix formatting problem in "say": word form note ("plural") is bigger than transcription note.
			Fix "pronounstrong form" in "he"
			"increase" - why "not kri:z" is bold?
			If starts with "—" usually begin a new line (see "go" for exception)
			Images - shouldn't be inside any frames?
			Fix "candidate", "Halley" errors: AmE pronunciation is not separated
			"detail", "direct"- preference poll attached to word form (same in the original entry)
			"wound" - past participle of
			"Agar, Adler" - split in two lines
		- Resolve references in LPD ("am" -> see "I'm", except ... -> ... (ref) ), also (go -> "See gonna") and MW
		- Get word forms from LPD and - in case if it exists as a separate entry in other dictionaries - generate a hypelink to the base form
		- MW: generate hyperlink for [ref] in transcription and other places (both in file system and database)
		- MW: extract some word forms as a dedicated word (e.g. forms of "to be")?
		- MW: add a ref to parent entry for variants and dervied words (see "deterrent") because thranscription is often incomplete.
		- LDOCE: add "especially" note (especially American English)?
		- MW: 
			resolve "in sense 2" to the real text ("abstract" -> "in sense 2 also ab ˈ")
			"abstract 3" doesn't have speech part (it's also missing in dsl)
			"he" - has two "noun" meanings. How to distingusih?
			"an" is joined incorrectly, "duplicate"
		- Get rid of <strong> in LPD.xml - convert to hyperlink
	- Ranks: 
		- Academic words: 
			- Add dropdown item
			- how to show them in UI?
	- LDOCE & MacMillan don't list US words (e.g. color). Maybe we should have separate lists?
	- LPD: add ability to specify which transcription does the sound actually relates to
	- Change color of dictionary name
	- Sound button is lower then collocation/MW entry
	- Add table Dictionaries. Register sound key prefix there (then change logic of current audio text in DictionaryContextt)
	- If possible - find other pronunciations inside LDOCE articles (e.g. for word forms - see abduction)
	- Analyze words that present in LPD but miss in LDOCE
	- Transform partial transcriptions into full ones and highlight the part
	- If word note presents - display it along with the dictionary article (as LDOCE does)
HTML to WPF migration:
	- Find a better way to distinguish buttons with the same audio key than displaying the key in UI
	- Display a note if a button has an assosiated recording (or display a list with all my recordings for this article?)
	- Allow to play the associated recording by clicking on the button (CTRL ?)
	- Change visual looks of buttons 
- Bugs
	- Alt+left/right arrow doesn't work when focus is inside the browser
	- When doubleclick on the item in audio list, refresh context is called two times: selection changed and double click
	- Add handling for "EntityValidationErrors" (too long text etc)
	- Bug: sometimes it's possible to start two players (rec and ref) simultineously
	- Bug when sequence is scheduled and I start another action
	- There are no tags in my exported mp3 files
	- Before removing the FakeEntity (for Exercise and Training) ensure they are not loaded into dbcontext
	- Parts of speech have dedicated tag in LDOCE/MW but in LPD they are just <em> (see "buffet")
	- When I click ESC to close a dialog and it has some changes and I click "OK" to discard them, the main window loses focus.
- Performance:
	- Get rid of entity framework in lists (Exercises, Trainings, Comboboxes, Categories) - use it only when updating/inserting detailed record
	- If we switch to using int32 instead of string as Words/Collocations reference to Sounds it reduces RAM by 4MB. Problems: can't easily cleanup Sounds table on reimport (foreign key)
	- Before deploying DB it should be warmed-up (load some pages etc)
	- Profile memory: when Exercise tab is first loaded etc.
	- If we assign all index entries for LPD it eats + 6 MB (slowly, in background)
	- Why it eats so much memory? Elaborate (try working without DB)
	- Why it eats so much memory when saving large audio files? (50 mb file and 400mb eats the application)
	- Test InMemory recorder - how much memory does it eats for long recordings? Should we flush to disk?
	- Optimize IsAudioExists calls (AudioPanel currently makes it twice)
	- Cache latest audio files in providers (especially, LPD)
	- Specify max DB size in the connection string - calculate it based on file size (max is 4000 Mb)
	- Think of another DB engine (SQLLite?). Test it with big databases and storing image/binary/ntext data.  
- New functionality:
	- Add "Play recorded" option to play my recordings on page load
	- Add "Phrase bank" functionality:
		- Import phrases from LDOCE (match sounds and text).
		- Add full-text search functionality and allow a user to record audio and compare with the reference one
	- Split .dat files into UK and US files to reduce download size
	- On first start ask which variant is preferred UK, US, both. Don't display UK/US buttons if another variant is selected.
	- Add a setting whether to display LDOCE and MW info (including words). Don't display MW words if user has chosen UK on first start. 
	- Add ability to pause the recording
	- Find some good dictionary with Russian translations
	- Add at least main russian meaning to the LPD (from popup dictionary?)
	- Import spelling-to-sound from LPD
	- Add ability to search by wildcards (e.g. select a certain problematic syllable - lrt - and practice many words with it)
	- Add ability to expand list when I click on "..." (e.g. I want to through all items)
	- Add a setting "Decrease recorded audio volume"
	- Long records: improve usability (back/forward a few seconds, repeat a region etc.)
	- Compare different reference pronunciation or different recorded ones
	- Add special signs explanation (LPD or Amazon)
	- Add a "Sound search" functionality
	- Create a text version of each sentence/phrase to be able to perform full text search
	- Play any word in the dictionary when I double click on it
	- Add ability to add any word in the exercise to dictionary favorites
	- Add a setting "Active book" to avoid displaying exercises from other books
	- Add auto lists: words with notes, trouble words (many attempts to rccord at a time)
	- Extract transcription for each word and store in the database
	- Add ability to search by phonetic symbols (see LPD implementation).
	- Add "Recent" tab to see my recent recordings (useful when learning words in dictionary)
	- Ability to backup and restore data
- Usability improvements
	- Favorite audio caption and logic is confusing
	- Ask confirmation in Training if I delete an audio. "Cancel" shouldn't delete my unsaved recordings?
	- Add detailed information on ranks
	- Main pronunciation in LPD: esnure main AmE pronunciation is shown in full (not partially)
	- Add a setting to display US/UK pronunciation only
	- Sometimes I want to assign to category a word form (e.g. earlier ->  hard to pronounce). It's not possible currently
	- Too little space for the category name
	- When pointing the cursor to category name should its full name and description
	- Display wveforms even during playback
	- Improve tab headers: add tooltips and icons
	- Add special and phonetic symbols explanations (both for LPD and LDOCE)
	- Improve category dialog: add with hot key, delete with DEL
	- Rename Trainings to Readings or Dialogs
	- Don't play Reference audio automatically after the recording for long audios?
	- Use + and - images instead of "Add"/"Delete" text
	- Make EN/US buttons in LPD html smaller when targeting database (they are rarely clicked)
	- Topics sorting in Exercise list is done by ID, not by text
	- Add parent topic to the topics list (align  right)
	- Add a switch to hide/display exercise description
	- We should be able to see waveforms when an audio is playing (but not when is recording)
	- Review logic for building TOP words - why it's 1200 instead of 1000?
	- Don't show message box if dictionary is missing - show error inside the tab (for those who don't want to use dictionary)
	- History dialog: duration is confusing without a caption
- Code improvements:
	- Use temp folder instead of "Recordings" when converting with LAME
	- Use unconverted audio for desktop?
	- Ensure all DB indexes, PKs, and relations don't have autogenerated names (because EF uses these names and may fail if we recreate the entity)
	- Add a handling to MessageHelper when message needs to be shown from a background thread
	- Use stack panel in AudioPanel (read first what is better: Grid or stack panel)
	- Use Lazy for Active record in Exercise/Trainig details dialog
	- Add error logging (write all errors to the log). 
	- Improve error handling during databinding: give more informative error messages. Sometimes errors are not thrown (raise error inside EditCategories.ascx -> Categories property)
	- Add a possibility to start background action passing arguments explicitly. Simplify delegates signatures (some don't need ActionContext etc.)
	- Check if page URLs like 'file://127.0.0.1/C$/Folder/.../file.html' will work for non-admins (see method PrepareNavigationUri() in DictionaryContainer)
Waveforms:
	- Add ability to play audio in the dialog
	 -Add ability to play selected part of a waveform
	- Select several recordings and display waveforms for all of them
	- Clip pauses at the end and at the beginning in the Waveform
	- Add ability to move and stretch waveforms with a slider
	- Add word name to the last played audio
	- Play sound along with moving a slider on waveform
	- Add ability to show real amplitude of the sounds (don't stretch them) to compare loudness 
Tests:
	- Test when there are no custom categories
Deployment:
	- Add logic to check if it's an updated version and call some migration logic (MUST be done before deployment!)
	- Think how a new changes to the database will be deployed (consider that all audio/html index will be broken)
	- Deploy also "Index.txt" to speedup first start
	- Would "<base href="D:\Learn\English\Pronunciation\Trainer\Dictionary/" />" work with low priviledges?

Possible problems:
- Deleting many exercises may cause an exception because IN statement would be too long (when deleting recorded audios)

Generation of the pages:
- check errors in "don't" - AmE is not separated 
- 'pause' transcript is incorrect in Lingvo
