Top:
- Store history of the recordings. Save best recordings with the date so that I was able to compare them over time to check my progress
- Allow separate recording of words if dictionary entry has several meanings (I, II)
- Add a button to remember/highlight a record in the Recorder
- Allow comparison of my own pronunciations at the wave forms dialog
- Compare different reference pronunciation or different recorded ones
- Add a shortcut for playing ref and rec sounds simultaneosuly

Waveforms:
- Clip pauses at the end and at the beginning in the Waveform
- Add ability to move and stretch waveforms with a slider
- Separate waveform on segments and allow to play a certain segment
- Add word name to the last played audio

Migration to DB:
- Do all work in a branch
- Try loading .html page from a database. Test performance. 
- Results:
	DB size: 2GB vs. 1GB in file system. To reduce size:
		- zip content to make (2x smaller) 
		- store binary data (image) instead of ntext to use UTF8
		- store mp3 separately to avoid Base64 conversion (1/4 smaller)
		- use Int32 keys instead of Guids (a few Mbs smaller)
	Need to change all hyperlinks on a page to call jscript function which calls external function
	What about images? Should we also embed them?
	Can we specify base folder for the browser control and put all other stuff (css, js, images) there?
	Reponse time is very fast.
- Generation:
	Add stubs for .css and .js injection
	Embed images
	Separate mp3 files. Specify which ones are main UK/US files
	Generate jscript function call instead of the direct link (don't forget about the file lists)
	Don't generate index file
	Specify Rank for each word in the table
	Don't combine similar words together?
	Add charset specification (UTF8)?
- Code:
	Specify max DB size in the connection string - calculate it based on file size (max is 4000 Mb)
	Cache last N files and played audio (preload only one audio? based on the playback settings)
	Generate words index based on the records from DB

Other:
- Add a switch to hide/display exercise desription
- Add recording duration to the recordings list
- Add column "CD+Track" instead of page and sort by it
- Add special signs explanation (LPD or Amazon)
- generate html for pronunciation notes (from dictionary CD)
- Create base MessageBox with predefined captions
- Allow recording when the application is not active
- Don't load all tabs on startup
- Open detailed dialogs as tabs of the Exercise list (as in MVVM article)
- Add text to exercises to enable full text search (?)
- Play any word in the dictionary when I double click on it

Generation of the pages:
- check errors in "don't" - AmE is not separated 
- 'pause' transcript is incorrect in Lingvo
