Top:
- Load of the first page takes too long (or maybe its only after reimport?)
- Waveforms: why right margin is so big?
- Delete a word from category with DEL (not Backspace, remove Backspace also from Recordings list) 
- Add ability to add notes for a word
- Add total statistics (recorded N words over Y days)
- Add ability to rewind player by 1/3 seconds (should be configurable)
- Find the best audio for "American Accent Training" paragraph (ex. 3-39 - read fast)
- Somehow mark the entries from LDOCE in UI
LDOCE import:
	- Change reimport: preserve WordId and CollocationsId and user-data (e.g. notes) when possible. We want to link to this data to word id
	- Optimize reimport: if we only change HTML then there's no need to rebuild Audio.dat 
	- Migrate categories to use WordId instead of word name.
	- ? DB mode: don't import sounds that have "_lpd_" inside and can be matched to the existing LPD sound. Remap them instead.
	- Check if [.stress_shift] style is ever applied in LPD entries
	- Backup new LPD database and PronunciationTrainer
	- Clean DIC folder and generate file system entries
	- ZIP sounds in LDOCE folder
	- Upload new HTML to iPhone (don't forget to change mobile .css)
	- If possible - find other pronunciations inside LDOCE articles (e.g. for word forms - see abduction)
- Bugs
	- Alt+left/right arrow doesn't work when focus is inside the browser
	- When doubleclick on the item in audio list, refresh context is called two times: selection changed and double click
	- Add handling for "EntityValidationErrors" (too long text etc)
	- Bug: sometimes it's possible to start two players (rec and ref) simultineously
	- Bug when sequence is scheduled and I start another action
	- There are no tags in my exported mp3 files
	- Before removing the FakeEntity (for Exercise and Training) ensure they are not loaded into dbcontext
- Performance:
	- Reduce startup time
	- First click on Exercise takes too long. Should we warm-up the connection somehow?
	- Profile memory: when Exercise tab is first loaded etc.
	- If we assign all index entries for LPD it eats + 6 MB (slowly, in background)
	- Why it eats so much memory? Elaborate (try working without DB)
	- Why it eats so much memory when saving large audio files? (50 mb file and 400mb eats the application)
	- Test InMemory recorder - how much memory does it eats for long recordings? Should we flush to disk?
	- Reduce startup time
	- Optimize IsAudioExists calls (AudioPanel currently makes it twice)
	- Cache latest audio files in providers (especially, LPD)
	- Specify max DB size in the connection string - calculate it based on file size (max is 4000 Mb)
	- Think of another DB engine (SQLLite?). Test it with big databases and storing image/binary/ntext data.  
	- Use other control instead of WebBrowser (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18119125/options-for-embedding-chromium-instead-of-ie-webbrowser-control-with-wpf-c)
- New functionality:
	- Import spelling-to-sound from LPD
	- During import add a flag "several pronunciations/meanings". Then use this flag for autolist "several pronunciations"
	- Add ability to search by wildcards (e.g. select a certain problematic syllable - lrt - and practice many words with it)
	- Add ability to expand list when I click on "..." (e.g. I want to through all items)
	- Add bility to exclude "collocations" from search (useful when moving down the list of words)
	- Add at least main russian meaning to the LPD
	- Add a setting "Decrease recorded audio volume"
	- Long records: improve usability (back/forward a few seconds, repeat a region etc.)
	- Compare different reference pronunciation or different recorded ones
	- Add special signs explanation (LPD or Amazon)
	- Add a "Sound search" functionality
	- Create a text version of each sentence/phrase to be able to perform full text search
	- Play any word in the dictionary when I double click on it
	- Add ability to add any word in the exercise to dictionary favorites
	- Add a setting "Active book" to avoid displaying exercises from other books
- Usability improvements
	- Add special and phonetic symbols explanations (both for LPD and LDOCE)
	- Improve category dialog: add with hot key, delete with DEL
	- Rename Trainings to Readings or Dialogs
	- Don't play Reference audio automatically after the recording for long audios?
	- Use + and - images instead of "Add"/"Delete" text
	- Make EN/US buttons in LPD html smaller when targeting database (they are rarely clicked)
	- Topics sorting in Exercise list is done by ID, not by text
	- Add parent topic to the topics list (align  right)
	- Add a switch to hide/display exercise description
	- We should be able to see waveforms when an audio is playing (but not when is recording)
	- Review logic for building TOP words - why it's 1200 instead of 1000?
	- Don't show message box if dictionary is missing - show error inside the tab (for those who don't want to use dictionary)
- Code improvements:
	- Add logic to check if it's an updated version and call some migration logic (MUST be done before deployment!)
	- Think how a new changes to the database will be deployed (consider that all audio/html index will be broken)
	- Use stack panel in AudioPanel (read first what is better: Grid or stack panel)
	- Use Lazy for Active record in Exercise/Trainig details dialog
	- Add error logging
	- Add a possibility to start background action passing arguments explicitly. Simplify delegates signatures (some don't need ActionContext etc.)
	- Check if page URLs like 'file://127.0.0.1/C$/Folder/.../file.html' will work for non-admins (see method PrepareNavigationUri() in DictionaryContainer)
Waveforms:
	- Add ability to play audio in the dialog
	 -Add ability to play selected part of a waveform
	- Select several recordings and display waveforms for all of them
	- Clip pauses at the end and at the beginning in the Waveform
	- Add ability to move and stretch waveforms with a slider
	- Add word name to the last played audio
	- Play sound along with moving a slider on waveform
	- Add ability to show real amplitude of the sounds (don't stretch them) to compare loudness 

Possible problems:
- Deleting many exercises may cause an exception because IN statement would be too long (when deleting recorded audios)

Generation of the pages:
- check errors in "don't" - AmE is not separated 
- 'pause' transcript is incorrect in Lingvo
