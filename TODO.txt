Top:
- Add a list with grammar notes (png images). Add these images to the different tab "Help" (use image container, not browser). Add them both to file and DB providers
- Should LPD html page be able to catch the focus (after TAB click)?
- Add a list "Unexpected pronunciation" (move files from Excel there)
- Find the best audio for "American Accent Training" paragraph (ex. 3-39 - read fast)
- Bugs
	- Alt+left/right arrow doesn't work when focus is inside the browser
	- When doubleclick on the item in audio list, refresh context is called two times: selection changed and double click
	- Add handling for "EntityValidationErrors" (too long text etc)
	- Bug: sometimes it's possible to start two players (rec and ref) simultineously
	- Bug when sequence is scheduled and I start another action
	- There are no tags in my exported mp3 files
	- Before removing the FakeEntity (for Exercise and Training) ensure they are not loaded into dbcontext
- Performance:
	- First click on Exercise takes too long. Should we warm-up the connection somehow?
	- Profile memory: when Exercise tab is first loaded etc.
	- If we assign all index entries for LPD it eats + 6 MB (slowly, in background)
	- Why it eats so much memory? Elaborate (try working without DB)
	- Why it eats so much memory when saving large audio files? (50 mb file and 400mb eats the application)
	- Test InMemory recorder - how much memory does it eats for long recordings? Should we flush to disk?
	- Reduce startup time
	- Optimize IsAudioExists calls (AudioPanel currently makes it twice)
	- Cache latest audio files in providers (especially, LPD)
	- Specify max DB size in the connection string - calculate it based on file size (max is 4000 Mb)
	- Think of another DB engine (SQLLite?). Test it with big databases and storing image/binary/ntext data.  
- New functionality:
	- Add ability to mark certain words as problematic and practice them later
	- Add ability to search by wildcards (e.g. select a certain problematic syllable - lrt - and practice many words with it)
	- Add ability to expand list when I click on "..." (e.g. I want to through all items)
	- Add bility to exclude "collocations" from search (useful when moving down the list of words)
	- Add at least main russian meaning to the LPD
	- Add a setting "Decrease recorded audio volume"
	- Compare different reference pronunciation or different recorded ones
	- Add special signs explanation (LPD or Amazon)
	- Generate html for pronunciation notes (from dictionary CD)
	- Add a "Sound search" functionality
	- Create a text version of each sentence/phrase to be able to perform full text search
	- Play any word in the dictionary when I double click on it
	- Add ability to add any word in the exercise to dictionary favorites
	- Add a setting "Active book" to avoid displaying exercises from other books
- Usability improvements
	- Improve category dialog: add with hot key, delete with DEL
	- Rename Trainings to Readings
	- Use + and - images instead of "Add"/"Delete" text
	- Make EN/US buttons in LPD html smaller when targeting database (they are rarely clicked)
	- Topics sorting in Exercise list is done by ID, not by text
	- Add parent topic to the topics list (align  right)
	- Add a switch to hide/display exercise description
	- We should be able to see waveforms when an audio is playing (but not when is recording)
	- Review logic for building TOP words - why it's 1200 instead of 1000?
- Code improvements:
	- Use stack panel in AudioPanel (read first what is better: Grid or stack panel)
	- Use Lazy for Active record in Exercise/Trainig details dialog
	- Add error logging
	- Add a possibility to start background action passing arguments explicitly. Simplify delegates signatures (some don't need ActionContext etc.)
	- Check if page URLs like 'file://127.0.0.1/C$/Folder/.../file.html' will work for non-admins (see method PrepareNavigationUri() in DictionaryContainer)

Waveforms:
 -Add ability to play certain part of waveform
- Select several recordings and display waveforms for all of them
- Clip pauses at the end and at the beginning in the Waveform
- Add ability to move and stretch waveforms with a slider
- Separate waveform on segments and allow to play a certain segment
- Add word name to the last played audio
- Play sound along with moving a slider on waveform
- Add ability to show real amplitude of the sounds (don't stretch them) to compare loudness 

Possible problems:
- Deleting many exercises may cause an exception because IN statement would be too long (when deleting recorded audios)

Generation of the pages:
- check errors in "don't" - AmE is not separated 
- 'pause' transcript is incorrect in Lingvo
