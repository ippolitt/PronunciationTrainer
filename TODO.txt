Waveforms:
- Implement logic of silence finder and automatically stop recording if there's a long pause

- Add ability to move and stretch waveforms with a slider
- Separate waveform on segments and allow to play a certain segment
- Add word name to the last played audio
- Play sound along with moving a slider on waveform

Migration to DB:
	Move RegisterPage method to LoadCompleted event
	Specify max DB size in the connection string - calculate it based on file size (max is 4000 Mb)
	Cache last N files and played audio (preload only one audio? based on the playback settings)

Generation of the pages:
- check errors in "don't" - AmE is not separated 
- 'pause' transcript is incorrect in Lingvo
