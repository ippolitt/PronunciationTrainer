Top:
- Clean sounds cache and rebuild it (to remove extra LDOCE sounds)
- Install MW standalone to be able to compare
- What is "1 is also"? See "there"
- Change color of dictionary name
- Find words that present only in MW (with several audios)
- Search: we must also match items with accented characters (e.g. à la carte)
- Add table with Dictionaries list
- Import MW dictionary. Remember, that with several pronunciations order is important (dog). Validate using words like [dog, awkward, author, law, water]
--
- Test in FileSystem
- Try installing video card, then try giving more memory to video adapter
- Delete a word from category with DEL (not Backspace, remove Backspace also from Recordings list) 
- Add records count to the suggestions list
- Add total statistics (recorded N words over Y days). Move statistics from status bar to a dedicated tab.
- Add ability to add notes for a word
- Add ability to rewind player by 1/3 seconds (should be configurable)
- Lazy load categories (only if tab is visible)
- Remove some logging
- Somehow mark the entries from LDOCE in UI
- Find the best audio for "American Accent Training" paragraph (ex. 3-39 - read fast)
LDOCE import:
	- Import also those audio that presents in LDOCE but misses in LPD (try matching by audio name)
	- Clean DIC folder and generate file system entries
	- Generate iPhone entries and upload them to iPhone (don't forget to change mobile .css)
	- If possible - find other pronunciations inside LDOCE articles (e.g. for word forms - see abduction)
	- Analyze words that present in LPD but miss in LDOCE
	- ? [analyze] DB mode: don't import sounds that have "_lpd_" inside and can be matched to the existing LPD sound. Remap them instead.
- Bugs
	- Alt+left/right arrow doesn't work when focus is inside the browser
	- When doubleclick on the item in audio list, refresh context is called two times: selection changed and double click
	- Add handling for "EntityValidationErrors" (too long text etc)
	- Bug: sometimes it's possible to start two players (rec and ref) simultineously
	- Bug when sequence is scheduled and I start another action
	- There are no tags in my exported mp3 files
	- Before removing the FakeEntity (for Exercise and Training) ensure they are not loaded into dbcontext
	- Parts of speech have deddicated tag in LDOCE/MW but in LPD they are just <em> (see "buffet")
- Performance:
	- Get rid of entity framework in lists (Exercises, Trainings, Comboboxes, Categories) - use it only when updating/inserting detailed record
	- If we switch to using int32 instead of string as Words/Collocations reference to Sounds it reduces RAM by 4MB. Problems: can't easily cleanup Sounds table on reimport (foreign key)
	- Before deploying DB it should be warmed-up (load some pages etc)
	- Profile memory: when Exercise tab is first loaded etc.
	- If we assign all index entries for LPD it eats + 6 MB (slowly, in background)
	- Why it eats so much memory? Elaborate (try working without DB)
	- Why it eats so much memory when saving large audio files? (50 mb file and 400mb eats the application)
	- Test InMemory recorder - how much memory does it eats for long recordings? Should we flush to disk?
	- Optimize IsAudioExists calls (AudioPanel currently makes it twice)
	- Cache latest audio files in providers (especially, LPD)
	- Specify max DB size in the connection string - calculate it based on file size (max is 4000 Mb)
	- Think of another DB engine (SQLLite?). Test it with big databases and storing image/binary/ntext data.  
	- Use other control instead of WebBrowser (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18119125/options-for-embedding-chromium-instead-of-ie-webbrowser-control-with-wpf-c)
- New functionality:
	- Add ability to pause the recording
	- Find some good dictionary with Russian translations
	- Somehow get CEPD pronunciations?
	- Import spelling-to-sound from LPD
	- During import add a flag "several pronunciations/meanings". Then use this flag for autolist "several pronunciations"
	- Add ability to search by wildcards (e.g. select a certain problematic syllable - lrt - and practice many words with it)
	- Add ability to expand list when I click on "..." (e.g. I want to through all items)
	- Add bility to exclude "collocations" from search (useful when moving down the list of words)
	- Add at least main russian meaning to the LPD (from popup dictionary?)
	- Add a setting "Decrease recorded audio volume"
	- Long records: improve usability (back/forward a few seconds, repeat a region etc.)
	- Compare different reference pronunciation or different recorded ones
	- Add special signs explanation (LPD or Amazon)
	- Add a "Sound search" functionality
	- Create a text version of each sentence/phrase to be able to perform full text search
	- Play any word in the dictionary when I double click on it
	- Add ability to add any word in the exercise to dictionary favorites
	- Add a setting "Active book" to avoid displaying exercises from other books
	- Add auto lists: words with notes, trouble words (many attempts to rccord at a time)
- Usability improvements
	- When pointing the cursor to category name should its full name and description
	- Display wveforms even during playback
	- Improve tab headers: add tooltips and icons
	- Add special and phonetic symbols explanations (both for LPD and LDOCE)
	- Improve category dialog: add with hot key, delete with DEL
	- Rename Trainings to Readings or Dialogs
	- Don't play Reference audio automatically after the recording for long audios?
	- Use + and - images instead of "Add"/"Delete" text
	- Make EN/US buttons in LPD html smaller when targeting database (they are rarely clicked)
	- Topics sorting in Exercise list is done by ID, not by text
	- Add parent topic to the topics list (align  right)
	- Add a switch to hide/display exercise description
	- We should be able to see waveforms when an audio is playing (but not when is recording)
	- Review logic for building TOP words - why it's 1200 instead of 1000?
	- Don't show message box if dictionary is missing - show error inside the tab (for those who don't want to use dictionary)
	- History dialog: duration is confusing without a caption
- Code improvements:
	- Add a handling to MessageHelper when message needs to be shown from a background thread
	- Use stack panel in AudioPanel (read first what is better: Grid or stack panel)
	- Use Lazy for Active record in Exercise/Trainig details dialog
	- Add error logging
	- Add a possibility to start background action passing arguments explicitly. Simplify delegates signatures (some don't need ActionContext etc.)
	- Check if page URLs like 'file://127.0.0.1/C$/Folder/.../file.html' will work for non-admins (see method PrepareNavigationUri() in DictionaryContainer)
Waveforms:
	- Add ability to play audio in the dialog
	 -Add ability to play selected part of a waveform
	- Select several recordings and display waveforms for all of them
	- Clip pauses at the end and at the beginning in the Waveform
	- Add ability to move and stretch waveforms with a slider
	- Add word name to the last played audio
	- Play sound along with moving a slider on waveform
	- Add ability to show real amplitude of the sounds (don't stretch them) to compare loudness 
Deployment:
	- Add logic to check if it's an updated version and call some migration logic (MUST be done before deployment!)
	- Think how a new changes to the database will be deployed (consider that all audio/html index will be broken)
	- Deploy also "Index.txt" to speedup first start

Possible problems:
- Deleting many exercises may cause an exception because IN statement would be too long (when deleting recorded audios)

Generation of the pages:
- check errors in "don't" - AmE is not separated 
- 'pause' transcript is incorrect in Lingvo
